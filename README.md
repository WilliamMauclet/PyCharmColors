# PyCharmColors
A personal colors make-up for PyCharm in dark mode because I was not satisfied with the available color schemes for dark Pycharm.

The following principles were followed:

* Dark
* Mate
* Colors must be used functionally to highlight different concepts
* The aesthetic function of colors comes in second place


Here are some screenshots:
