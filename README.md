# PyCharmColors
A personal colors make-up for PyCharm in dark mode because I was not satisfied with the available color schemes for dark Pycharm.

These principles are followed:

* Dark
* Mate
* Colors must be used functionally to show illuminate concepts
* The aesthetic function of colors comes in second place
